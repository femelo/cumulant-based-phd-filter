# Labeled Cumulant-based PHD filter

This is a README file for a Python implementation of a labeled extension of the cumulant-based PHD filter also known as [linear complexity filter](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8455331) for tracking objects in images.

## Requirements
  - Ubuntu >= 16.04
  - Python 2 or 3
  - OpenCV >= 3.2
  - Munkres == 1.0.12

## **1.** Installing system dependencies.

```
sudo apt-get install python python-pip python-dev python3-dev python3-pip libopencv-dev python-opencv python3-opencv imagemagick libtiff-tools
```

**Note:** The package *imagemagick* provides an image manipulation tools including *convert* and the package *libtiff-tools* provides the tools *tiffinfo* and *tiffcrop*. These tools may be needed to extract image sequences encapsulated in TIFF containers. The script 'Data/extract.sh' is provided for that purpose
and depends on those tools.

## **2.** Clone the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/femelo/cumulant-based-phd-filter
```

## **3.** Install Python dependencies.

Change directory to the code base directory.
```
cd cumulant-based-phd-filter
```

For Python 2:
```
pip install -r requirements_python2.txt
```

For Python 3:
```
pip3 install -r requirements_python3.txt
```

## **4.** Download and untar the data file in the source directory.
```
tar zxvf Data.tar.gz
```
**Note:** No data is provided with the code due to licensing or lack thereof.

## **5.** Edit the *settings.json* file for changing the algorithm settings.

## **6.** Run the code.

For Python 2:
```
python track.py -ds WAMI -iv wami01 -d -v
```

For Python 3:
```
python3 track.py -ds WAMI -iv wami01 -d -v
```

All options for the command line program can be seen by checking the help as:
```
python3 track.py -h
```

To run the tracker for all video sequences of the WAMI dataset, the provided bash
script does the job:
```
./run_tracker.sh
```
